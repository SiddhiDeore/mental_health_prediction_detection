# Mental Health Prediction Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a Mental Health Prediction project.
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict mental health conditions based on various input features.

# Project Overview
Mental health is an important aspect of overall well-being, and early detection and prediction of mental health conditions can significantly help in providing timely support and intervention. 
This project aims to address this issue by developing a predictive model that can identify potential mental health conditions based on a set of input features.

The main components of the project include:

Data collection and preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
Deployment and usage of the trained model
